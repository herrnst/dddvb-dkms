Redirection of TS streams through CI modules is now supported 
through /sys/class/ddbridge/ddbridge0/redirect.
It only works with cards based on the ddbridge PCIe bridge, not
with nGene based cards.

It is set up in such a way that you can write "AB CD" to
a "redirect" attribute and data from input B of card A is then piped through
port D (meaning TAB (D+1) which uses output D and input 2*D for CI io)
of card C and then shows up in the demux device belonging to
input B (input (B&1) of TAB (B/2+1)) of card A.

E.g.:

echo "00 01" > /sys/class/ddbridge/ddbridge0/redirect

will pipe input 0 of card 0 through CI at port 1 (TAB 2) of card 0.

Redirection should only be down right after loading the driver 
(or booting if the driver is built-in) and before using the
devices in any way.
